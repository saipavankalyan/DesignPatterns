#Design Principles

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation
3. Favor compositon over inheritance
   - Creating systems using composition gives you a lot more flexibility. You can change the behavior of objects at runtime by composing them in different ways.
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
